## 📁 Projects

### 🔹 Basics

#### 🎲 Number Guessing Game — Console
A simple console game where the player guesses a randomly generated number between **1–100**.

**What it practices:**
* 🔁 Loops & conditionals
* ⌨️ User input & type conversion
* 🎲 `Random` number generation

#### 🖥️ Number Guessing Game — GUI (.NET MAUI)
A **graphical version** of the Number Guessing Game built using **.NET MAUI** and **XAML**.

**Key highlights:**
* 🎨 Clean and responsive UI
* 🧠 Event-driven logic
* 🔘 Button-based interaction
* 💬 Instant feedback for each guess

**Concepts practiced:**
* .NET MAUI project structure
* XAML layouts
