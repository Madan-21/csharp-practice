# C# Practice

This repository contains my C# practice projects as I learn and improve my programming skills.

## Projects

### Basics
- **Number Guessing Game** - A console game where the player guesses a random number between 1-100. The game provides feedback (too high/too low) until the correct number is guessed. Practices loops, conditionals, user input, and the Random class.

## Goals
- Practice C# fundamentals through hands-on projects
- Build coding muscle memory with real implementations
- Learn version control with Git and GitHub
- Create a portfolio of small, working projects
- Transform theoretical knowledge into practical skills

## Progress
✅ Completed W3Schools C# course (100%)  
✅ Built first working project - Number Guessing Game  
🚀 Currently working through basic concepts and building small console applications

## What I'm Learning
- Control flow (loops, conditionals)
- User input handling and data conversion
- Random number generation
- Git workflow and version control

*This is a learning journey - code may not be perfect, but every project is a step forward!*
