C# Practice

This repository contains my C# practice projects as I learn and improve my programming skills, starting from basic console applications to modern GUI-based apps.

Projects
Basics
🎯 Number Guessing Game (Console)

A console-based game where the player guesses a random number between 1–100.

Provides feedback such as “Too High” or “Too Low” until the correct number is guessed.

Helps practice:

Loops and conditionals

User input and type conversion

Random class usage

🖥️ Number Guessing Game (GUI – .NET MAUI)

A graphical user interface (GUI) version of the Number Guessing Game built using .NET MAUI.

Allows users to enter guesses using input fields and buttons instead of the console.

Features:

Clean UI with XAML

Event-driven programming

Real-time feedback on guesses

Helps practice:

.NET MAUI project structure

XAML layouts

Code-behind logic

Cross-platform app development concepts

Goals

Practice C# fundamentals through hands-on projects

Build coding muscle memory with real implementations

Learn version control with Git and GitHub

Create a portfolio of small, working projects

Transition from console applications to GUI-based apps

Transform theoretical knowledge into practical skills

Progress

✅ Completed W3Schools C# course (100%)
✅ Built first working console project
✅ Added .NET MAUI GUI version of Number Guessing Game
🚀 Continuing with basic concepts and UI-based applications

What I'm Learning

Control flow (loops, conditionals)

User input handling and data conversion

Random number generation

Console vs GUI application development

.NET MAUI fundamentals

Git workflow and version control

This is a learning journey — the code may not be perfect, but every project is a step forward 🚀
